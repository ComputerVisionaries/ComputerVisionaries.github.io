<h1><strong>Proposal</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Problem Statement</strong></h2>
<br>

<h3><i>Project Goal</i></h3>
We wish to develop a fast, robust, and accurate jigsaw puzzle solver.
<br><br>

The idea for this project was inspired by the work of Sholomon, David, & Netanyahu [1], as well as T. Allen [2].
<br><br>

Sholomon, David, & Netanyahu demonstrate how genetic algorithms can be used to reconstruct images after they have been broken into small squares and scrambled.
Allen's paper focuses on solving simple canonical puzzles with non-square shapes using image processing techniques.
<br><br>

Sholmon, David, & Netanyahu's method was shown to work on large puzzles (+20,000 pieces) but is fragile.
Their algorithm is assumed to fail if any of the pieces are missing, rotated, or damaged.
As well, their system only works on images, and was not shown to work on physical jigsaw puzzles.
<br><br>

Allen's method was shown to work on restricted physical puzzles.
The examples givin in his paper are of small jigsaw puzzles (fewer than 20 pieces).
His system demonstrates flexibility in its ability to solve the puzzle when the input pieces are rotated or jumbled.
Finally, Allen's algorithm failed to show to combined pieces put together (it just showed compatible pieces next to each other)
<br><br>

Using the above techniques, we wish to derive our own algorithm for puzzle assembly considering increasingly more complex piece shapes and rotations.<br>

TODO : NEEDED?
We will then compare our results to that of research on the subject using cumulative error-based metrics.

<h3><i>Input</i></h3>
An image of a jigsaw puzzle that follows the bellow assumptions.<br><br>

Assumptions
<ul>
  <li> All pieces are facing upwards </li>
  <li> All piece edges are clearly visible </li>
  <li> The background is a solid color </li>
  <li> All pieces are distinguishable from the background </li>
</ul>
